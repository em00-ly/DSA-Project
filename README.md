PhoneBook Application

SECTION A: Algorithms representation of the different modules and/functions (Pseudocode/flowchart) 


Project summary 
A Namibian telecommunications company is looking for an efficient phonebook 
algorithm based on basic linear data structures, the key is to use simple, well-known data structures and 
algorithms that can still deliver reasonably efficient performance for typical phonebook operations (insert, 
search, delete, update). Linear data structures such as arrays and linked lists are relatively simple to 
implement and understand, making them ideal for simpler systems. Students are free to explore more 
advanced and efficient structures such as tries, hash tables etcetera. 

Below are the created operations

1. Insert Contact 
2. Search Contact 
3. Display all contacts 
4. Delete Contact 
5. Update Contact 
6. Sort Contacts (optional, for faster search) 
7. Analyze the efficiency of your search algorithm (in #2 above)
